# Temporary Scripts (Auto-Cleanup Zone)

⚠️ **WARNING: Files in this directory are automatically deleted after 30 days!**

## 🎯 Purpose
This directory is for very short-term scripts, quick experiments, and one-off debugging tasks.

## 🗑️ Auto-Cleanup Policy
- **Cleanup Frequency**: Daily check
- **Retention Period**: 30 days from last modification
- **No Warnings**: Files are deleted automatically
- **No Recovery**: Deleted files are not recoverable

## ✅ Perfect for:
- Quick debugging scripts
- One-time data checks  
- Immediate problem solving
- Fast prototypes
- Testing API calls
- Temporary fixes

## ❌ NOT for:
- Scripts you want to keep
- Work in progress over multiple days
- Anything important or reusable
- Scripts with valuable patterns

## 📝 Naming Suggestions
- `20250126_debug_mcp_connection.py` - Date prefix for tracking
- `quick_test_agent_response.py` - Clear purpose
- `temp_fix_nam_123.py` - Reference Linear issue
- `debug_memory_tool.py` - Descriptive name

## 🔄 Promotion Path
If you want to keep a script longer:
1. **Short-term experimentation** → Move to `../sandbox/`
2. **Reusable tool** → Move to `../tools/`
3. **Production utility** → Move to `../../scripts/` (with review)

---

**Remember**: Treat this as truly temporary storage. If in doubt, use `../sandbox/` instead.
