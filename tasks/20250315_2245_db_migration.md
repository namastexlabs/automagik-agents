# Database Migration Report

## Migration Task Summary

We have completed the migration from deprecated database utilities in `src/utils/db.py` to the new, clean repository pattern in `src/db`. This involved updating imports and function calls across multiple files in the codebase.

## Background

The database access layer was refactored to use a clean repository pattern in `src/db`, but many parts of the codebase were still using the deprecated utilities from `src/utils/db.py`. This migration ensures all code is using the new database access methods to maintain consistency and avoid deprecated warnings.

## Changes Made

### Core Components

#### 1. Main Application (`src/main.py`)
- Replaced imports from `src.utils.db` with `src.db`
- Changed import statements: 
  ```python
  from src.utils.db import execute_query
  # changed to
  from src.db import execute_query
  ```
- Also updated nested imports:
  ```python
  from src.utils.db import get_connection_pool, execute_query
  # changed to
  from src.db import get_connection_pool, execute_query
  ```
- This ensures the application initializes correctly with the proper database connections

#### 2. Message Store (`src/memory/pg_message_store.py`)
- Replaced all imports from `src.utils.db` with `src.db`
- Updated both `execute_query`, `execute_batch`, and `get_connection_pool` imports
- Changes affect the PostgreSQL message store initialization and database operations

#### 3. API Routes (`src/api/routes.py`)
- Replaced imports from `src.utils.db` with `src.db`
- Updated import for both `execute_query` and `get_db_connection`
- This affects all database operations performed through the API routes

### Agent-Related Components

#### 4. Sofia Agent (`src/agents/simple/sofia_agent/agent.py`)
- Updated imports in two locations within the file:
  - Main import at the top of the file
  - Import in the `register_tools` method
- Both instances changed from `src.utils.db` to `src.db`
- This ensures the agent's memory tools work correctly with the database

#### 5. Memory Tools Update (`src/tools/memory_tools/update.py`)
- Replaced the import from `src.utils.db` with `src.db`
- This ensures memory update operations use the new database utilities

#### 6. Agent Database Operations (`src/agents/models/agent_db.py`)
- Updated import from `src.utils.db` to `src.db`
- This affects all agent database operations including registration and management

### Scripts and Tests

#### 7. View Memory Tools Script (`scripts/view_memory_tools.py`)
- Updated imports in two locations:
  - Main import at the top of the file
  - Import in the `register_memory_tools` function
- Both changed from `src.utils.db` to `src.db`

#### 8. Direct Description Test Script (`scripts/direct_description_test.py`)
- Updated import from `src.utils.db` to `src.db`
- This affects the memory tools description testing

#### 9. Tool Description Inspector (`scripts/tool_description_inspector.py`)
- Updated import from `src.utils.db` to `src.db`
- This enables proper database access when inspecting tool descriptions

#### 10. Cleanup Memory Read Modes Script (`scripts/cleanup_memory_read_modes.py`)
- Updated import from `src.utils.db` to `src.db`
- This ensures the cleanup script can properly access and modify memory read modes

#### 11. Sofia Memory API Test (`tests/standalone/test_sofia_memory_api.py`)
- Updated import from `src.utils.db` to `src.db`
- This enables proper testing of the memory API functionality

#### 12. Memory Agent Example (`docs/examples/memory_agent.py`)
- Updated import from `src.utils.db` to `src.db`
- This allows the example to properly initialize database connections

### Additional Fix

#### 13. DB Init Module (`src/db/__init__.py`)
- Added `get_connection_pool` to the exported connection functions:
  ```python
  # Export connection functions
  from src.db.connection import (
      execute_query,
      execute_batch,
      get_db_connection,
      get_db_cursor,
      close_connection_pool,
      get_connection_pool,  # Added this export
  )
  ```
- This fixes the missing export that was causing the import error:
  ```
  ImportError: cannot import name 'get_connection_pool' from 'src.db'
  ```

## Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Missing Export in `src/db/__init__.py`**: The `get_connection_pool` function was not being exported from the module, causing import errors in files that were updated to use the new pattern. This was fixed by adding the export to the `__init__.py` file.

2. **Deprecated Function in `memory_tools/__init__.py`**: The `write_memory` function was already marked as deprecated and internally using the new `create_memory` and `update_memory` functions, so no changes were needed.

## Verification Steps

1. After making these changes, the application was tested by running it and verifying:
   - The application initializes correctly with the new database connections
   - No warnings about deprecated DB utilities are shown in the logs
   - Database operations function as expected

2. All files were manually inspected to ensure:
   - All imports were properly updated
   - No references to the old module remain
   - Functions are called with the correct parameters

## Next Steps

1. The remaining deprecated functions in `src/utils/db.py` should eventually be removed once all code is fully migrated
2. Consider a more comprehensive refactoring to use repository functions instead of direct SQL queries where appropriate
3. Add database schema migrations and versioning if not already implemented
