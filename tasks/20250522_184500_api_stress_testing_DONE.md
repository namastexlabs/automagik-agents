# Task: Enhanced API Stress Testing Framework
**Status**: Completed

## Analysis
- [x] Requirements
  - [x] Build on existing benchmark script to add comprehensive stress testing
  - [x] Test multiple endpoints, not just agent/run
  - [x] Test session queue functionality under load
  - [x] Measure performance of recent session queue fixes
  - [x] Support different payload types and sizes
  - [x] Monitor memory usage and connection handling
- [x] Challenges
  - [x] Need to test authentication with API keys
  - [x] Test different types of endpoints (GET, POST, DELETE)
  - [x] Validate session queue merging under real load
  - [x] Need realistic payloads for different agent types
- [x] Dependencies
  - [x] Existing benchmark script: scripts/benchmarks/agent_run_bench.py
  - [x] API endpoints from agent_routes.py, user_routes.py, etc.

## Plan
- [x] Step 1: Create enhanced stress test script
  - [x] Extend existing benchmark with multi-endpoint support
  - [x] Add authentication handling
  - [x] Add different payload scenarios
- [x] Step 2: Add session queue stress tests
  - [x] Test rapid messages to same session ID
  - [x] Verify merging behavior under load
  - [x] Test concurrent sessions
- [x] Step 3: Create performance monitoring
  - [x] Memory usage tracking
  - [x] Connection pool monitoring
  - [x] Error rate tracking
- [x] Step 4: Test and document results
  - [x] Create comprehensive documentation
  - [x] Document performance characteristics

## Execution
- [x] Implementation 1: Enhanced stress test script
  - [x] Files created: scripts/benchmarks/api_stress_test.py
  - [x] Files created: docs/stress_testing.md

## Summary
- [x] Files created: `scripts/benchmarks/api_stress_test.py` (comprehensive stress testing tool)
- [x] Files created: `docs/stress_testing.md` (documentation and usage guide)
- [x] Dependencies added/changed: Uses existing httpx, psutil for monitoring
- [x] Edge cases considered: Load balancing, connection limits, session queue merging
- [x] Known limitations: Requires psutil package for performance monitoring
- [x] Future impact points: API performance monitoring, CI/CD integration
