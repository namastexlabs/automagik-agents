# Analysis of PydanticAI Implementation Issues

## Background
The system is currently experiencing errors when trying to run the SimpleAgent:
- `Agent.run() got an unexpected keyword argument 'system_prompt'`
- `Agent.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'usage_limits'`

These errors suggest mismatches between how the PydanticAI library is being used in the code and how it's actually implemented or documented.

## Initial Analysis
From the logs, it appears that the SimpleAgent is trying to pass parameters that aren't supported by the PydanticAI Agent class. Let's analyze both the documentation and the implementation to identify where the mismatch occurs.

## Plan
1. Analyze `agent.md` documentation and compare with SimpleAgent implementation
2. Analyze `chat_history.md` documentation for any issues related to message handling
3. Analyze `models.md` documentation to ensure proper model initialization
4. Analyze `openai.md` documentation to ensure proper OpenAI model configuration
5. Propose fixes for the identified issues

## Investigation Progress

### 1. agent.md Documentation Analysis
Based on the SimpleAgent implementation in `src/agents/simple/simple_agent/agent.py`, I've observed:

- The `Agent.run()` method in SimpleAgent is trying to pass a `system_prompt` parameter when running the agent, but this isn't a valid parameter for the PydanticAI `Agent.run()` method.
- The error `Agent.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'usage_limits'` suggests that usage_limits is being passed directly to the Agent constructor when it should be used elsewhere.

According to the PydanticAI documentation in `agent.md`:

1. System prompts should be configured during Agent initialization:
   ```python
   agent = Agent(
       'openai:gpt-4o',
       deps_type=str,
       result_type=bool,
       system_prompt=('Use the `roulette_wheel` function to see if the '
                     'customer has won based on the number they provide.')
   )
   ```

2. Dynamic system prompts can be defined via functions decorated with `@agent.system_prompt`.

3. For the `run()` method, the valid parameters are:
   ```python
   result = agent.run(user_prompt, deps=deps, message_history=message_history)
   ```

4. Usage limits should be passed to the `run()` method, not the constructor:
   ```python
   result_sync = agent.run_sync(
       'What is the capital of Italy? Answer with just the city.',
       usage_limits=UsageLimits(response_tokens_limit=10),
   )
   ```

The SimpleAgent code needs to be updated to:
1. Move the `system_prompt` parameter from the `run()` call to the Agent initialization
2. Ensure usage_limits is passed to the `run()` method, not the constructor
3. Fix how model settings are applied

### 2. chat_history.md Documentation Analysis

The chat_history.md documentation provides insights into how message history should be handled:

1. After an agent run, messages can be accessed via:
   ```python
   # All messages from the run including prior messages
   result.all_messages()
   
   # Only new messages from the current run
   result.new_messages()
   ```

2. To continue a conversation using previous messages:
   ```python
   result2 = agent.run_sync('Explain?', message_history=result1.new_messages())
   ```

3. When `message_history` is set and not empty, a new system prompt is not generated - the system assumes the existing message history includes a system prompt.

Looking at our implementation in SimpleAgent:
```python
# Get or create message history
message_history = self.dependencies.get_message_history()

result = await self._agent_instance.run(
    agent_input,
    message_history=message_history,
    system_prompt=system_message,  # This is the problematic parameter
    usage_limits=usage_limits
)
```

The issue is that we're trying to pass both `message_history` and `system_prompt`, which is contradictory according to the documentation. If we're passing a message history, we shouldn't also be passing a system prompt separately - the system prompt should already be part of the message history.

### 3. models.md Documentation Analysis

The models.md documentation explains how to configure different model providers and how to use them with PydanticAI. Key points relevant to our issues:

1. Models can be specified directly during agent creation:
   ```python
   agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')
   ```

2. Model settings should be applied through the `model_settings` parameter:
   ```python
   # During agent creation
   agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', model_settings={'temperature': 0.0})
   
   # Or during run
   result_sync = agent.run_sync(
       'What is the capital of Italy?', model_settings={'temperature': 0.0}
   )
   ```

3. Usage limits are separate from model settings and are passed to run methods:
   ```python
   result_sync = agent.run_sync(
       'What is the capital of Italy? Answer with just the city.',
       usage_limits=UsageLimits(response_tokens_limit=10),
   )
   ```

Looking at our SimpleAgent implementation, there are several issues:

```python
try:
    self._agent_instance = PydanticAgent(
        model=model_name,
        system_prompt=self.system_prompt,
        tools=tools,
        model_settings=model_settings
    )
    logger.info(f"Initialized agent with model: {model_name}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to initialize agent: {str(e)}")
    raise
```

This looks correct for model initialization, but we're still seeing issues with the `usage_limits` parameter. The error suggests that `usage_limits` is being passed to the constructor when it should only be passed to the run methods.

### 4. openai.md Documentation Analysis

The openai.md documentation focuses on using OpenAI models with PydanticAI. Key points relevant to our issues:

1. OpenAI models can be specified either via string format or by creating an OpenAIModel instance:
   ```python
   # By name
   agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')
   
   # By model instance
   from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
   model = OpenAIModel('gpt-4o')
   agent = Agent(model)
   ```

2. API keys are typically set through environment variables:
   ```python
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
   ```

3. We can also set the API key programmatically via the provider:
   ```python
   from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider
   model = OpenAIModel('gpt-4o', provider=OpenAIProvider(api_key='your-api-key'))
   ```

Our implementation in SimpleAgent appears to be using the OpenAI model correctly by specifying the model name with the 'openai:' prefix. The issue isn't with the OpenAI configuration but with how we're calling the Agent's methods.

## Identified Issues and Recommendations

After analyzing the documentation and comparing it with our SimpleAgent implementation, I've identified the following issues:

1. **Wrong Parameters to Agent.run()**:
   - `system_prompt` parameter shouldn't be passed to `run()` but instead should be configured during Agent initialization or via dynamic system prompts.
   - Usage limits should be passed to `run()` but not to the Agent constructor.

2. **Message History and System Prompt Conflict**:
   - We're trying to pass both `message_history` and `system_prompt` to `run()` which is contradictory - if message history exists, we shouldn't be passing a separate system prompt.

## Implemented Fixes

I've made the following fixes to the code:

1. **Fixed SimpleAgent.run() method**: Removed the `system_prompt` parameter from the `Agent.run()` call:
   ```python
   # Before
   result = await self._agent_instance.run(
       agent_input,
       message_history=message_history,
       system_prompt=system_message,  # This was causing the error
       usage_limits=usage_limits
   )
   
   # After
   result = await self._agent_instance.run(
       agent_input,
       message_history=message_history,
       usage_limits=usage_limits
   )
   ```

2. **Improved handling of system messages**: Added proper handling for cases where a system message is provided for a single run but no message history exists:
   ```python
   # If a system message is provided for this run and we don't have message history,
   # we need to reinitialize the agent with the new system prompt
   if system_message and not message_history:
       temp_system_prompt = self.system_prompt
       self.system_prompt = system_message
       self._agent_instance = None  # Force reinitialization
       await self._initialize_agent()
       self.system_prompt = temp_system_prompt  # Restore original
   ```

3. **Checked for usage_limits misusage**: Searched the codebase for any instances where `usage_limits` might be incorrectly passed to the Agent constructor, but didn't find any such issues. It seems the error might have been fixed in a previous update.

These changes should resolve the errors and allow the SimpleAgent to correctly use the PydanticAI Agent class according to the documentation.
