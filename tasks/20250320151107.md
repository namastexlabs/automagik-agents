# Debug Session Duplication and Message Storage Issues

## Analysis

Based on the investigation of run.py and message_history.py, there are two main issues:

1. **Session Duplication**: When using run.py to test an agent, two sessions are created instead of one. The database shows two sessions with different IDs for what should be a single request.

2. **Missing Messages**: No messages are being inserted into the messages table when agents run.

The key components involved:
- `run.py` - CLI client that sends requests to the API endpoint
- `message_history.py` - Manages message history and performs database operations
- `routes.py` - Contains the API endpoint that processes agent requests

The issue appears to be in how session management works between the CLI client and API server, and in how message storage is implemented.

## Plan

1. Debug session duplication:
   - Analyze `src/api/routes.py` to understand how it creates and manages sessions
   - Examine the flow when `session_name` is provided in run.py vs when it isn't
   - Check when and how multiple MessageHistory instances are created

2. Debug message storage:
   - Verify the database connection is working properly
   - Check if `create_message` function is actually being called
   - Inspect error handling in message creation
   - Check if there are any exceptions being swallowed in MessageHistory methods

3. Fix session duplication:
   - Update session handling logic to prevent double creation
   - Ensure consistent session ID usage throughout the request flow

4. Fix message storage:
   - Add proper error handling and validation for message insertion
   - Ensure message model fields match database schema
   - Add debugging to track message creation attempts

## Execution

### Session Duplication Issue

The problem appears in `src/api/routes.py` around line 107:
```python
# Create message history instance instead of message store
message_history = MessageHistory(session_id=None, user_id=request.user_id)
```

This creates a MessageHistory instance with `session_id=None` which then creates a new session.

Later in the same file around line 313:
```python
# MessageHistory should now be initialized with the correct session_id
message_history = MessageHistory(request.session_id, user_id=request.user_id)
```

Another MessageHistory instance is created with the session ID, but the first one already created a session.

The fix would be to remove the first MessageHistory initialization and only create it once with the correct session ID.

### Message Storage Issue

In `src/memory/message_history.py`, the `create_message` function is called correctly for user messages and assistant responses, but:

1. The create_message function in the repository might be failing silently due to exception handling
2. There may be data type mismatches between the Message model and database schema
3. Potentially, database transactions aren't being committed properly

The most likely issue is an exception happening during message creation that's being caught and only logged without raising or properly handling the error.

## Testing

1. Add debug logging to the `create_message` function in `src/db/repository/message.py` to capture all parameters and error details.

2. Modify `MessageHistory` class to ensure errors during message creation are properly logged and potentially rethrow important exceptions.

3. Test by running:
```bash
automagik-agents agent run message --agent simple --message "Test message" --debug
```

4. Check database directly after test:
```sql
SELECT * FROM sessions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM messages WHERE session_id IN (SELECT id FROM sessions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 2);
```

## Summary

The root causes appear to be:

1. **Session Duplication**: Two MessageHistory instances are being created in routes.py (first with null session_id and then with the actual session_id), each creating its own session.

2. **Missing Messages**: Likely due to exceptions during message creation being caught and only logged without proper handling. The issue could be with data format, transaction management, or database connection issues.

The fixes would involve:
1. Eliminating the first MessageHistory initialization in routes.py
2. Adding better error handling and debugging to message creation
3. Ensuring message data matches the expected database schema
4. Verifying transaction handling in the repository layer

Files modified:
- `src/api/routes.py`: Lines 107-112 (remove initial MessageHistory creation)
- `src/memory/message_history.py`: Improve error handling for create_message calls
- `src/db/repository/message.py`: Add better debugging for failed operations

These changes should ensure messages are properly saved and only one session is created per request.
