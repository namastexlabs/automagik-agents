# Memory API Bug Fix Plan

## Issue Summary
The memory API endpoints were returning server-side errors:
1. Batch endpoint failure: `name 'execute_query' is not defined`
2. Individual endpoint issues: `'coroutine' object has no attribute 'id'`

These appeared to be implementation issues related to async/await patterns and missing function references.

## Implementation Summary

### Fixes Implemented

1. Added missing import:
   ```python
   from src.db import execute_query
   ```

2. Renamed API route handlers to avoid naming conflicts with imported functions:
   ```python
   async def get_memory_endpoint(memory_id: str = Path(...))  # Changed from get_memory
   async def update_memory_endpoint(...)  # Changed from update_memory
   async def delete_memory_endpoint(...)  # Changed from delete_memory
   ```

3. Replaced direct SQL queries with repository function calls:
   ```python
   # Before
   result = execute_query(query, (memory_id_str,))
   return MemoryResponse(**result[0])
   
   # After
   memory = get_memory(uuid_obj)
   return MemoryResponse(id=str(memory.id), ...)
   ```

4. Updated the batch endpoint to use the repository functions for each memory in the batch.

## Testing Verification

The fix was tested with the `insert_sofia_memories.py` script and successfully created all memories:

```
2025-03-18 15:47:54,983 - INFO - Memory insertion completed successfully using batch endpoint
2025-03-18 15:47:54,983 - INFO - Created memory: personal_identity_traits (ID: 90489feb-20c3-4857-a472-1bf6f0929f37)
2025-03-18 15:47:54,983 - INFO - Created memory: personal_interests (ID: 205e573b-b39d-47ae-bdb1-14090437205b)
...
```

All 12 memories were successfully created without errors.

## Technical Debt Recommendations

For future development, consider:

1. Creating automated tests that validate the API with both individual and batch operations.
2. Implementing proper error handling for batch operations to provide detailed errors for each failed item.
3. Standardizing the usage pattern of repository functions vs direct SQL queries across the codebase.
4. Adding stronger type checking and validation for memory IDs and other UUID fields.
