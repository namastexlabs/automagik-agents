# Tool System Refactoring and Standardization

## Analysis
The current tools implementation has several issues:
- Circular references causing infinite loops and system crashes:
  - `src/tools/common_tools/memory_tools.py` imports from `src/tools/memory_tools` which creates a potential circular dependency
  - The app loops until it crashes and can't be stopped normally
- Redundant code with multiple implementations:
  - `memory_tools.py` in common_tools folder
  - `memory_tools/` dedicated folder with multiple files
  - Various tool files scattered across the root src/tools directory
- Inconsistent organization across tools
- Tool outputs not properly captured, saved, or returned in requests
- No standard structure for tool definitions with Pydantic schemas

The project needs a comprehensive refactoring to establish a consistent pattern for all tools, improve observability, and eliminate redundancy.

## Plan
We'll implement a standardized structure with one folder per tool, containing the tool code and Pydantic schemas for inputs/outputs. This will make the codebase more maintainable and easier to extend.

### Phase 1: Define New Structure
- [x] Define the new folder structure template
- [x] Create Pydantic model templates for tool inputs/outputs

### Phase 2: Memory Tools Refactoring
- [x] Fix circular reference in memory tools by implementing a proper layered architecture
- [x] Move memory_tools implementation to new structure (src/tools/memory/)
- [x] Create proper Pydantic models for memory tool inputs/outputs
- [x] Ensure proper output capture and return
- [x] Add comprehensive tests
- [x] Create test script for memory tools

### Phase 3: Migrate Common Tools
- [x] Migrate datetime_tools to new structure
- [ ] Migrate document_tools to new structure
- [ ] Migrate image_tools to new structure
- [ ] Migrate audio_tools to new structure
- [ ] Migrate text_tools to new structure
- [ ] Migrate date_tools to new structure
- [ ] Migrate web_tools to new structure

### Phase 4: Migrate Remaining Tools
- [ ] Migrate discord_tools to new structure
- [ ] Migrate notion_tools to new structure
- [ ] Migrate blackpearl_tools to new structure
- [ ] Migrate omie_tools to new structure
- [ ] Migrate google_drive_tools to new structure
- [ ] Migrate evolution_tools to new structure
- [ ] Migrate chroma_tools to new structure

### Phase 5: Integration and Cleanup
- [x] Update main __init__.py to use new structure
- [ ] Remove redundant files and folders
- [ ] Update imports throughout the codebase
- [ ] Fix any broken references

## Execution

### 1. New Folder Structure Template
Each tool will follow this structure:
```
src/tools/
  ├── memory/
  │   ├── __init__.py           # Exports the tool functions
  │   ├── schema.py             # Pydantic models for inputs/outputs
  │   ├── tool.py               # Implementation of the tool
  │   ├── provider.py           # Optional: backend service provider
  │   └── test_memory.py        # Tests for the tool
  ├── datetime/
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   ├── schema.py
  │   ├── tool.py
  │   └── test_datetime.py
  └── ...
```

### 2. Tool Schema Template
Each tool will define its inputs and outputs using Pydantic models:
```python
# schema.py example
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional, Any, Dict, List

class ToolInput(BaseModel):
    """Input parameters for the tool."""
    param1: str = Field(..., description="Description of parameter 1")
    param2: Optional[int] = Field(None, description="Description of parameter 2")

class ToolOutput(BaseModel):
    """Output from the tool."""
    result: Any = Field(..., description="The result of the tool operation")
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict, description="Additional metadata")
```

### 3. Tool Implementation Template
```python
# tool.py example
import logging
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional
from .schema import ToolInput, ToolOutput

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

async def execute_tool(input_data: ToolInput) -> ToolOutput:
    """Execute the tool with the given input.
    
    Args:
        input_data: The tool input parameters
        
    Returns:
        The tool output
    """
    logger.info(f"Executing tool with {input_data}")
    
    # Tool implementation here
    result = process_input(input_data)
    
    # Return standardized output
    return ToolOutput(
        result=result,
        metadata={"timestamp": get_current_time()}
    )
```

### 4. Memory Tools Implementation Plan

1. First, we'll create the new structure:
```
src/tools/memory/
  ├── __init__.py          # Exports read_memory, create_memory, update_memory
  ├── schema.py            # Defines memory models and tool I/O
  ├── tool.py              # Core implementation
  ├── provider.py          # Memory provider implementation
  └── test_memory.py       # Tests
```

2. Break the circular dependency:
   - Move the memory provider implementation from memory_tools/provider.py to memory/provider.py
   - Implement tool.py with direct database access (no circular imports)
   - Ensure common_tools/memory_tools.py is updated to import from the new location

3. Fix output capturing:
   - Use Pydantic models for standardized outputs
   - Ensure all tool functions return proper objects
   - Add logging for key operations

### 5. Datetime Tools Implementation

We've migrated the datetime tools to follow the same pattern:

```
src/tools/datetime/
  ├── __init__.py          # Exports get_current_date, get_current_time
  ├── schema.py            # Defines DatetimeInput and DatetimeOutput
  ├── tool.py              # Core implementation
  └── test_datetime.py     # Tests
```

Key improvements:
- Added structured outputs with Pydantic models
- Added more comprehensive logging
- Added support for custom date/time format strings
- Created comprehensive tests

### 6. Integration Progress

To ensure the new tools are properly integrated, we've taken the following steps:

1. Updated the main `src/tools/__init__.py` to:
   - Import datetime tools from the new location (src/tools/datetime)
   - Import memory tools from the new location (src/tools/memory)
   - Expose all tools through the module's public API

2. This update ensures that existing code using these tools will continue to work without modification, while allowing us to migrate the remaining tools incrementally.

### 7. Implementation Progress
- Created directory structure for src/tools/memory/
- Implemented schema.py with Pydantic models for inputs/outputs
- Implemented provider.py to manage memory caching
- Implemented interface.py with helper functions
- Implemented tool.py with core functionality
- Updated common_tools/memory_tools.py to use new implementation
- Created __init__.py to expose the API
- Added comprehensive test suite in tests/test_memory_tools.py
- Created a test entry script in src/tools/memory/test_memory.py
- Migrated datetime_tools to the new structure
- Updated main tools/__init__.py to use new structure

### 8. Next Steps
- Migrate remaining common tools to new structure
- Migrate other specialized tools
- Update imports throughout the codebase
- Remove redundant files after successful testing

## Testing
- For each refactored tool:
  - Test the tool in isolation
  - Test integration with the agent system
  - Verify output is correctly captured and returned
  - Verify no circular references
  - Benchmark for performance issues

## Summary
This refactoring will organize the codebase with a clear, consistent structure for all tools. Each tool will have its own directory with dedicated files for schemas, implementation, and tests. This will eliminate redundancy, improve maintainability, and make it easier to add new tools in the future.

The main focus areas are:
1. Fixing the circular reference causing system crashes
2. Ensuring tool outputs are properly captured and returned
3. Standardizing the tool structure with Pydantic schemas
4. Eliminating redundancy
5. Improving observability

First phase of implementation is complete. We have migrated the memory tools to the new structure, breaking the circular dependency that was causing the system to crash. Each component now has clear responsibilities and returns standardized outputs using Pydantic models, improving observability.

Testing of the memory tools has been implemented with:
1. Unit tests for all components in the tests/test_memory_tools.py file
2. A test script in src/tools/memory/test_memory.py for interactive testing
3. Validation that all tools properly capture, process, and return outputs

We've also migrated the datetime tools to the new structure, enhancing them with better output formatting, error handling, and comprehensive testing. This provides a clear pattern for migrating the remaining tools.

The main package __init__.py has been updated to expose the tools from their new locations, ensuring backward compatibility while we migrate the remaining tools.
