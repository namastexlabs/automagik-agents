# Project Rulebook Index

This file lists **all rule documentation** available under `.cursor/rules/`.
Start here‚Äîwhether you are a **human engineer** or an **AI code-assistant**.

## How to Consume This Rulebook

1. **Read in numerical order**.  Each section builds on concepts introduced by the previous one.
2. **Follow _imperative_ sentences literally** (e.g. "Never access environment variables directly").  They are **hard rules**‚Äì‚Äìnot suggestions.
3. When coding inside Cursor, **load only the sub-folders relevant to your task** to keep context windows small.
4. If the code appears to violate a rule, prefer **raising an issue / PR** over silently patching it.
5. AI agents must cite the rule *and line number* that justifies a design decision in their commit message.

> Each sub-folder contains a `README.mdc` that acts as the canonical document for that topic. Older standalone rule files will be migrated gradually.

## üîç Quick Lookup Matrix (for AI agents)

| If your task involves‚Ä¶ | Read these sections **before** coding |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
Updating environment variables | 04 Configuration, 08 Dependencies |
Creating / editing an Agent class | 02 Agent Development, 01 Project |
Adding a new external integration (HTTP, SDK) | 03 Tool Development, 07 Logging |
Database schema or queries | 05 Database |
Writing or updating tests | 06 Testing / CI |
Adjusting logging behaviour | 07 Logging |
Formatting, linting, PR flow | 09 Style & PR Etiquette |

**Rule for AI assistants**: Before emitting any code change, consult the matrix, open relevant `README.mdc` files, and cite the section line(s) that justify your implementation.
